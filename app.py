        **Understanding the Box Plot:**

        - **X-Axis (Horizontal):**  
          This axis shows different time periods (called 'Tech Eras'):
          - **Tech 1.0 (1970-1990)**
          - **Tech 2.0 (1991-2010)**
          - **Tech 3.0 (2011-present)**
          
          These eras represent times when technology was first introduced and later improved.
          
        - **Y-Axis (Vertical):**  
          This axis shows the "tech adoption score."  
          - A **low score (closer to 0)** means fewer people were using new technology.
          - A **high score (closer to 1)** means more people adopted new technology.
          
        - **The Box Itself:**  
          - The box shows the middle range of the data (from the 25th to the 75th percentile).
          - The line inside the box is the **median**, which is the middle value.
          
        - **Whiskers and Outliers:**  
          - Lines extending from the box (whiskers) show the overall spread of the scores.
          - Points outside the whiskers are considered unusual values (outliers).
          
        - **Hover Information:**  
          - When you hover your mouse over a box, extra details (like region, income level, and age group) will appear.
          
        **What This Chart Tells Us:**  
        - In **Tech 1.0**, tech adoption scores are generally lower, meaning fewer people used new technology.  
        - In later eras (**Tech 2.0** and **Tech 3.0**), scores increase, showing that more people adopted technology over time.

        **What is happening here?**  
        This section uses your inputs to calculate a simple "score" that helps predict how likely a consumer is to adopt new technology.

        **Inputs Explained:**  
        - **Technological Era:**  
          Choose the time period (e.g., Tech 1.0, Tech 2.0, or Tech 3.0).  
          This tells us when the consumer is interacting with technology.
          
        - **Income Level and Age Group:**  
          These provide context about the consumer's background.
          
        - **Digital Literacy Score:**  
          A value from 0 to 1 that shows how familiar the consumer is with technology.  
          A higher score means the consumer is more comfortable with tech.
          
        - **Tech Anxiety Score:**  
          A value from 0 to 1 that indicates how much anxiety or stress the consumer feels about using new technology.  
          A higher score means more anxiety.
          
        - **Social Influence Score:**  
          A value from 0 to 1 that reflects how much the consumer's peers influence their tech decisions.
          
        - **Annual Tech Purchases and Average Spend:**  
          These numbers show how often and how much the consumer spends on tech products.

        **How the Prediction Works:**  
        The system calculates a simple score using this formula:  
        **Score = Digital Literacy - Tech Anxiety + (Annual Purchases / 10)**  
        
        Based on the score:  
        - If the score is **less than 0.5**, the prediction is **Low Adoption**.  
        - If the score is **between 0.5 and 1.0**, the prediction is **Medium Adoption**.  
        - If the score is **1.0 or higher**, the prediction is **High Adoption**.

        **Note:** This is a simulated prediction for demonstration purposes. In a real application, you would replace this simple calculation with a machine learning model for more accurate results.
